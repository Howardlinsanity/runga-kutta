# 2nd and 4th Order Runge-Kutta Methods
Authors: Howard Lin, Danny Lu

For our Math 352 Project, we have decided to implement Runge-Kutta in Python.
Our module/file is rk.py, and there are 4 notable functions:
- Runge-Kutta of Order 2, single iteration
- Runge-Kutta of Order 2, n iterations
- Runge-Kutta of Order 4, single iteration
- Runge-Kutta of Order 4, n iterations

# Running the program

We have set it up so that you can run our program through two ways: 
- Through the Python3 shell
- Editing the main function in rk.py

Depending on how you want to run or test the program, follow ONE of the instructions below.

# Using the Python3 shell
1. Enter the python shell by entering the terminal and type in `python3` in the directory that rk.py is in.
2. Type in `>>> import rk`
3. Define your math function that only takes in the parameter `t` and `x` in that order (The order important, if your function takes in `x` and then `t` the Runge-Kutta module will fail)
4. Call a function from the library and follow the parameters in the comments of the file. See example below: 
```
$ python3

>>> import rk
>>> def f(t,x):
...     return 2 + (x - t - 1)**2
... 
>>> result = rk.fourth_order_rk(f,1,2,0.5625)
>>> # we are gonna approximate x(1.5624) with initial value x(1) = 2
... 
>>> print(result)
3.192481613086853
>>> 
```

# Using the main function
If for whatever reason you can't run the program in the shell, just edit rk.py
    1. First change `def f(t,x)` to the function you would like, using any python3 math functions
    2. In the `if __name__ == "__main__":` function, call the desired Runga-Kutta Method and the `f` function.
    3. In the terminal or Python3 interpreter (e.g. IDLE), run the program using `$ python3 rk.py` 
    
Example: 
In the end of `rk.py`:
```
'''
This is the f(t,x) function
'''
def f(t,x):
    return 2 + (x - t - 1)*(x - t -1)

'''
    This is the main function
'''
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello there! This is the main file")
    result = fourth_order_rk(f,1,2,0.5625)
    # we are gonna approximate x(1.5624) with initial value x(1) = 2
    print(result)
```

And then in the terminal:
```
 âœ˜ $ python3 rk.py
Hello there! This is the main file
3.192481613086853
```
